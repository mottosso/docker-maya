# Usage

To use this image and any of it's supported tags, use `docker run`.

```bash
$ docker run -ti --rm mottosso/maya
```

Without a "tag", this would download the latest available image of Maya. You can explicitly specify a version with a tag.


```bash
$ docker run -ti --rm mottosso/maya:2022
```

Images occupy around **5 gb** of virtual disk space once installed, and about **1.5 gb** of bandwidth to download.

**Example**

This example will run the latest available version of Maya, create a new scene and save it in your current working directory.

```bash
$ docker run -ti -v $(pwd):/root/workdir --rm mottosso/maya
$ mayapy
>>> from maya import standalone, cmds
>>> standalone.initialize()
>>> cmds.file(new=True)
>>> cmds.polySphere(radius=2)
>>> cmds.file(rename="my_scene.ma")
>>> cmds.file(save=True, type="mayaAscii")
>>> exit()
$ cp /root/maya/projects/default/scenes/my_scene.ma workdir/my_scene.ma
$ exit
$ cat my_scene.ma
```
